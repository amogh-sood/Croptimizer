        <h1>HOW DOES THIS WORK?</h1>
        <p class="centered-text">As farmers, you provide vital data 
            such as soil conditions, weather patterns, and other relevant
             factors, to generate a detailed prediction of the expected crop 
             yield and then we leverage this input to give you a clear estimate of what
              your harvest is likely to produce under current conditions.</p>

         <h1>OUR GOAL!</h1>
         <p class="centered-text">Croptimizer is built using advanced 
            neural networks that analyze real-world agricultural
             data to help farmers make informed decisions. We used the 
             <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield?resource=download" target="_blank">Agriculture Crop Yield Dataset</a>
              from Kaggle as a foundation for our model. 
              This dataset contains crucial factors such as soil conditions, crop types, weather data, and yield statistics across various regions, 
              which enabled us to train our model on real agricultural patterns. 
         
         However, we believe that our predictions could become even more accurate with more diverse data. If you have access to more 
         localized data, whether itâ€™s related to different crop types, regional climate data, or specific farming practices, we would 
         love to integrate it into our model. By continuously expanding our dataset, we can help you andfarmers across the globe make better 
         predictions, optimize their farming strategies, and ultimately increase their crop yields.</p>
